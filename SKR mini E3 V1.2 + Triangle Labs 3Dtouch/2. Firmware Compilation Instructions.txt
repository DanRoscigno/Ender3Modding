FIRMWARE COMPILATION INSTTRUCTIONS

1. The Marlin source code attached was based on BigTreeTech's SKR mini e3 V1.2 code from their github repo and has the following lines already activated or modified for BLTOUCH/3DTOUCH to run:
    a. In Marlin-2.0.x/Marlin/Configure.h

        - #define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT   { 80, 80, 400, 412 } on line 724. Change the last number to 93 if you have the stock extruder (I use a BMG clone)

        - #define Z_MIN_PROBE_USES_Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_PIN on line 820. This is needed since we're connecting the probe to where the Z limit switch was (there seems to be a bug when trying to use the intented "probe" pin).

        - #define BLTOUCH on line 870

        - #define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET {-44, -14, 0} on line 928. These correspond to the X, Y, Z offset of the probe referenced to the nozzle. If you use the same mount I recommended on file 0, you don't need to change the non zero values. If you use a different one, you'll have to figure out the X and Y offset of your probe. There's a diagram in the source code for doing so.
        
        - #define MIN_PROBE_EDGE 20 on line 931. This means the probe keeps off 20 mm from any edge of the bed (to avoid obstacles, like clips and whatnot, modify as needed).
    
        - #define AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR on line 1171.

        - #define Z_SAFE_HOMING on line 1322. Enforces homing X and Y before homing Z to avoid accidents.

    b. In Marlin-2.0.x/Marlin/Configure_adv.h
        - #define BLTOUCH_SET_5V_MODE on line 576.

        - #define BABYSTEPPING on line 1285.

        - #define BABYSTEP_MULTIPLICATOR 5 on line 1290. This makes babystepping a bit faster (steps are super small).

        - #define BABYSTEP_PROBE_OFFSET on line 1305. Allows you to fine tune the Z value of "NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET" (on the LCD even!)

2. Follow the instructions in the following link to install the enviroment for compiling: https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode

3. After that's done, restart VSCode just in case and in the "Pio Home" tab that will greet you, click on "Open Project" and open the Marlin-2.0.x folder.

4. Make any extra modifications you want or need to the firmware and then look in the gutter (the bottom menu), for a check mark. Click it to compile and wait for a minute or so until it says it's done.

5. Navigate to the build folder (the ".pio" folder in the path could be a hidden folder in your system) the relative path from where this file is, should be "./Marlin-2.0.x/.pio/build/STM32F103RC_bigtree/"

6. In the folder you'll see a "firmware.bin" file. Copy it to a clean SD formatted to FAT32.

7. Eject the SD and put it on your printer. Turn your printer on and wait for it to turn on completely. After that, put the SD in the slot, and then open the case to the mainboard and press the reset button that's behind the USB port.

8. Wait till it reboots and you're done.

9. Go to Instruction File "3. Probe Calibration".
